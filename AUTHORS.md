## Author

The `Kruskal-Veldman` library is developed by:
- [Dominique Larchey-Wendling](https://members.loria.fr/DLarchey/files/) (<dominique.larchey-Wendling@loria.fr>), CNRS researcher in the TYPES team at LORIA.

It is now part of the [`Coq-Kruskal` project](https://github.com/DmxLarchey/Coq-Kruskal) that covers the development of several libraries
and applications culminating in the [constructive proof of Kruskal's tree theorem](https://github.com/DmxLarchey/Kruskal-Theorems) and 
the construction of [Harvey Friedman's `TREE(n)` monster function](https://github.com/DmxLarchey/Friedman-TREE) in the inductive
type theory of Coq.

## Origin

It is was extracted from a complete rework of [the proof of Kruskal's tree theorem](https://members.loria.fr/DLarchey/files/Kruskal/index.html), 
now based on dependent vectors instead of lists, but can be used independently under the Mozilla Public License MPL-2.0.
